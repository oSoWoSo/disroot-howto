|What is a pastebin?|
|:--:|
|A pastebin is a content hosting service that allows you to upload and share text online.|

**Some of the things you can use it for**:

- Quickly share content of a text file with anyone without a need of copy/pasting large chunk of text or sending email with the content
- Publish information/documents online so that others can access
- Using it as a disposable message board, using it's message board feature
- Sending information to someone, via a url link that needs to be "burned after reading"
- Send someone a copy of a script or piece of code, note or confidential information you dont want anyone else to see.


In this how2 we'll see how to use PrivateBin at [bin.disroot.org](https://bin.disroot.org)
