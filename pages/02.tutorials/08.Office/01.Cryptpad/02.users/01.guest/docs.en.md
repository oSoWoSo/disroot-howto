# Guest users

Although guest users can access and use all the applications and common collaboration and sharing features without registering, there are a few important limitations to note:

1. The **CryptDrive** and **document management** features are reduced

- Pads are stored to open them later
- **Folders** creation and **Tags** are not available
- **Templates** (create/export/import) is not available

2. **Collaboration features** such as **Teams**, **Calendars** and **Contacts** are not available

3. The **storage time is limited to 90 days of inactivity** (per document)

4. **Profile customization** is not available

Ok, let's check the **settings** and **basics** of **CryptPad**
