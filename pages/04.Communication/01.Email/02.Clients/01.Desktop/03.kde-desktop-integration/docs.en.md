KMail is KDE default mail client.
The advantage of using KMail is that it integrates with your desktop and [Kaddressbook](/cloud/apps/contacts/desktop/kde-desktop-integration). Use a package manager to install KMail if it is not installed by default on your favourite distro.  

The client will ask you to add an account the first time you will launch KMail.
 - Follow instructions to fill in all your credentials:
   - **Full name:** *Name that will be displayed in "from" field*
   - **E-mail:** *yourusername@disroot.org*
   - **Password:** *your_super_secret_password*
   - Click "**Next**" button once you're done and verified everything is correct...

   - Click "**Next**" button once you're done.
