# News App on Disroot

To get into the app from web browser, just click news app icon ![](en/news_top_icon.png?resize=20,20) in the top bar. General idea behind the app is very simple: you add the RSS-feed of your favorite sites, get notifications on new articles and read them without the need to go to all those websites, by opening lots of tabs and get distracted half way.

## Add new feeds
Most of the websites provide [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) or Atom feeds. Once you have the RSS link ready, you can copy it and add it to your news app.
To add the feed simply click on the **"+ Subscribe"** button and fill in the URL of the feed you previously copied.

## Feed options
Every feed can be optimized to your needs. Clicking on **"Three dot"** icon:
