# Idea behind pads
The idea behind this software is very simple. It's a text/spreadsheet editor that lives in the web. Everything you type in gets written to your pad automatically. You can work on a document with multiple people at the same time without a need to save and pass copies of the documents to each other. Once your work is done, you can export the pad to a format of your choice.
