4. Depending on your needs you can either decided to export:
    - **Your subscriptions (OPML)** - This is specially useful if you want to change your News feed (RSS reader) provider or if you simply would like to have a backup of current news site list.<br> _[**OPML**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML) is a type of format widely used by existing news feed readers for importing and exporting subscriptions list._

    - **Unread/Starred articles** - This is the option to export the content of the articles themselves, either for offline reading, archiving or migration. <br>_[**JSON**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) is a text format for data exchange._

When you click **Export** the browser will ask you where you want to save the file, select a location and finally **Save**.
