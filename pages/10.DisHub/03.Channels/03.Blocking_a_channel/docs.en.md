## What does block a channel do?

Well, lets say you don't want any contact with somebody, for example beacouse this somebody spams you or beacouse their comments just disturb you. You can simply block that contact.  

There are two way of blocking:
* Block a channel
 * This means that the channel will not be able to read any of your items, and he will also not be able to write to your channel. Good to know is that it doesn't matter with what permission you post someting, that channel will still be unable to see your activies.  
* Block completely a channel
 * It's like blocking a channel but it also make that you won't even see that channel. It's like the channel doesn't exist anymore. Exept if that channel post something for example on a forum an you are also connectet to that forum. You won't see his posts on your channel but you will see them if you are visiting the forum page.
