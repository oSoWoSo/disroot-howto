Exporting your news feeds and your subscriptions is as easy as in case of any **Nextcloud** app.

3. Select Settings on the bottom of the left side-bar.

5. Depending on your needs you can either decided to export:
  - Your subscriptions (OPML) - This is specially useful if you want to change your News feed (RSS reader) provider or if you simply would like to have a backup of current news site list.
  - Unread/Starred articles - If you want to export the article content themselves either for offline use, archive purpose or migration. Note read articles get removed in regular intervals.
