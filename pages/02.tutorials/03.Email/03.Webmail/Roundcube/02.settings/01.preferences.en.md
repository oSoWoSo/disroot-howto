The user preferences let you adjust various options and settings that control the behavior and the UI of the webmail application. Since there are a lot of them, we will see the main ones.

After changing preferences, don’t forget to save them by clicking the **Save** button below the settings form.

- **Allow remote ressources (images, styles)**: formatted (HTML) messages can contain references to images which have to be loaded from a remote server.

In **Settings**, **Preferences**, choose **Server Settings**
