The user preferences let you adjust various options and settings that control the behavior and the UI of the webmail application. *If you want to learn much more, check the [Roundcube documentation](https://docs.roundcube.net/doc/help/1.1/en_US/settings/preferences.html)*

After changing preferences, don’t forget to save them by clicking the **Save** button below the settings form.

![UI](en/ui.png)

#### Main Options are:

- **Language**: The webmail interface language is automatically selected from that of your computer’s operating system. However, if it does not or you want to change it to a specific language, you can do it here.

- **Time zone**: The client automatically translates dates into your local time zone. By default, it is set to **Auto**, allowing webmail to use the time zone configured on your computer. If you want/need to change it, just select a specific time zone from the list.

- **Time format**: Select how time is displayed.

- **Date format**: Select how dates should be displayed.

- **Pretty dates**: This option "translates" dates close to today into relative terms like “Today”, “Yesterday”, etc.

- **Refresh (check for new messages, etc.)**: Select how often the client will look for new messages.

#### Interface Skin
Here is where you can choose how the webclient look like. **Beetroot** is the default **Disroot Webmail** flavor.

#### Browser Options
