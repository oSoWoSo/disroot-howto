4. **Swipe accept, and you're done!**
Now you are ready to start preaching people to ditch corporate evil apps and jump on the federation starship.

SailfishOS integrates all messaging into one app so now you can sms, skype, and chat from one place.
**All your contacts are synced between all the clients, so you can use disroot chat on all the devices at the same time.**
