# Email

# Composing emails

To create an email, click on the **Compose** button.

## Compose screen overview
Now we will see the **compose screen** and learn the basics of creating and sending emails from the **Disroot Webmail**.

Depending on your settings it will open the compose screen in the current browser tab or in a new window.

### 1. Shortcuts

  - **Save**: Saves a draft of a message in the Drafts folder if it is not yet complete and you need/want to finish and send it later. The email stored in the Drafts folder can be double-clicked there in order to resume composition.

  - **Attach**: Opens the file manager to attach a file. You can see the attachment information in the **Options and attachments** section (4) on the right of the screen.

  - **Signature**: Adds a signature to the message.

  - **Responses**: Inserts a pre-formatted reply in the body of the message. By clicking on this option, you can select, create or edit a response.

### 2. Sending information

You must already know this essential part of the process. Here is the information regarding **who is sending** the mail (**From**), **who is receiving** it (**To**) and the **Subject** of the message.

Let's go over these three fields and its options.

#### From

If you have no other identities configured, the default one will automatically appear here. In case you have them, click the arrows icon at the far right of the field to select the one you want to use.

### To

![](en/to_contacts_add.png)

To add one or more recipients you can:
- **a. Type the contact name or address**. While doing it, the webmail will search your address book and suggests matching entries below the input field. Select one by using the cursor keys (up/down) on the keyboard and then press **Enter** or **Tab** to copy the selected address into the **To** field.
- **b. Select it from the address book** by clicking the contact icon ![](en/contact_icon.png).

  ![](en/to_contacts_add_1.png)

  The **address book widget** will open. Select the address book to browse on the upper part of the widget (1), you will see the contacts listed below.

  Only a limited number of contacts is displayed at a time so use the arrow buttons in the widget bottom (2) to navigate the contacts or to go to the next page of them.

  Select the contact(s) you want to add and click **Insert**

#### Additional options

![](en/recipient_options.png)

At the end of the **To** field, you have some additional **Recipient** options.

- **Cc** (Carbon copy or Courtesy copy): Use this option when you want to send a copy of the message to another contact(s). **Cc** list will be visible to all recipients.

- **Bcc** (Blind copy): This option allows you to send an exact copy of the message to one or more recipients but their email will be hidden from others.

- **Reply-To**: This option allows you to specify a **Reply-To** address different from **From** address.

- **Followup-To**: This option is generally used when you want to get an answer from someone who has been sent a message previously and from whom we have had no response after a certain time.


### Subject

Here you type the subject of the email.
