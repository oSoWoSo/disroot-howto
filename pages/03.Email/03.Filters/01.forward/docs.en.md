We understand that not everyone wants to use disroot mail as their daily driver. People have their mail accounts for years and it is hard, not practical or in some cases even impossible for them to switch to another provider such as disroot.

However, there are important information you should not miss out on.

 - Get  notifications for forum and nextcloud. Those services are tight to disroot email and you cannot change it.
 - To be up to date with what's going on in dirsoot. Every three /six weeks we are sending email to all users informing them about recent developments, new features and services. We are also sending information about scheduled downtime of services if they are longer then 20 min. We have no intention to spam you with too much information so don't worry about that.

In this short howto I would like to show you how to forward your disroot emails to your preferred email address
(it should take you no more then 3minutes to get this setup).

## Steps needed to forward your mail

1. **Login to webmail** (https://mail.disroot.org)

3. Once in Settings **Hit Filter Tab.**
Filters help you manage your emails. Based on your filer conditions, you can move, copy, forward any email automatically. This is quite straight forward so if you want to setup some extra filters just look around. Here I'll show you how to setup forwarding filter for all your mail.

 - Give your filter a name
 - If no conditions specified, filter will apply to all incoming emails, which is what we want, so **do not add any conditions** for that filter.
 - From "**Action**" Dropdown menu select "**Forward to**" option, and add email address you want all emails to be forwarded to.
 - Once you are done, hit the "**Done**" button.
 - In order for the filter to be set to active you need to "**Save**" it.
