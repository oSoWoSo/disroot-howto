# How to backup your contacts and import them into Roundcube
Although there should be no problem with switching webmail clients, it is highly recommended that you backup your addressbook.

The suggested, easiest and quickest way is to _export_ your contacts from the **Contacts** app in the cloud.

## Exporting contacts from the cloud

1. Login to your **Disroot** cloud and select the **Contacts** app;
2. go to the **Settings** menu at the bottom left;
3. click on the three-dot menu to the right of the addressbook you want to export and select **Download**.
