For this tutorial we chose use the ownCloud Notes app. It's available in F-Droid and in other commercial app stores.    

In F-Droid the app is also called "Notes"

Once you start the ownCloud Notes app for the first time you will be prompt to write the server address and your account credentials.


> Server address: [https://cloud.disroot.org/](https://cloud.disroot.org/)

> Password: Your disroot password

After that just press "connect".<br>
