Disroot has contacts app enabled.

In this tutorial we'll show you how to setup and use your Disroot ontacts on your Android device.
To do this you will need to install the DAVx⁵ in Android.
For Open Tasks to work it will need DAVx⁵ to also be installed, but if you just want to sync your calendar or contacts you don't need to install Open Tasks.


----------
# Install DAVx⁵
## From appstore
DAVx⁵ Is available on your favorite app store. We encourage you to use [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/).

## From NextcloudApp
If you have nextcloud mobile app installed and linked to your Disroot cloud you can install it from there:
 - Open Nextcloud Android App
 - Got to settings > **"Sync calendar and contacts"**

 NextcloudApp will now fetch, install and configure your account automagically.

 ---------------

## Add your Disroot account to DAVx⁵

If you haven't install DAVx⁵ via NextcloudApp you will have to manually setup an account.
To get started open-up "DAVx⁵ app" and press the *"plus"* (**+**) button.

# Contacts
Your Contacts should be straight away available and synced with Disroot.
**Note:**
If you want to migrate your Android contacts to your Disroot contacts and stop syncing with Google, then follow [this](https://howto.disroot.org/en/nextcloud/sync-with-your-cloud/android/migrating-contacts-from-google) tutorial.
