# Disroot Webmail

A webmail, or web-based email, is an email service that can be accessed using the web browser. This means we don't need to install an email client software on our devices. The main advantage of webmail over the use of a desktop email client is the ability to send and receive email anywhere from a web browser.

**Disroot** webmail solution is powered by **Roundcube**, a free and open source webmail software.

Through the following tutorial, we will learn how to use **Roundcube** and get to know its features.
