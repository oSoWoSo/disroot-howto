# Using Calendar app

You can access your calendar app by pressing the ![](en/calendar_top_icon.png) icon in the top bar.
*Left-bar* in the calendar window gives you an overview of your calendars, their options and general settings.

## Create Calendar
To create a new calendar in this options panel press "*create calendar*"
A small prompt will appear where you can type the name you want to give to this new calendar and select a color for it.
Then press "*create*".

You can create multiple calendars for different purposes (work, activism, etc.) by repeating this process. If you do that, you can use different colors to set them apart (last icon is the color picker which allows you to choose any color you want![](en/calendar_colorpick_icon.png)).

  - start and end date
  - start and end time

  - event location
