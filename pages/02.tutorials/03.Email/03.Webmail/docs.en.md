# Disroot Webmail

A webmail, or web-based email, is an email service that can be accessed using the web browser. This means you don't need to install an email client software on your device. The main advantage of webmail over the use of a desktop email client is the ability to send and receive email anywhere from a web browser.

**Disroot** webmail solution is powered by **Roundcube**.
