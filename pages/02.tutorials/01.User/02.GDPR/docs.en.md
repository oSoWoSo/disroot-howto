#  How-to Self-export your personal data

At **Disroot** pretty much all data collected is the one you provide when using services (we store your files because you choose to store files on our cloud). We have no interest in acquiring and collecting any extra data nor processing it to sell to advertisement companies or in any way use to monetize on it. Therefor most of the services provides you with a way to self export your data. This chapter includes tutorials that will help you get all the data stored on services provided by **Disroot** and connected to your account.
