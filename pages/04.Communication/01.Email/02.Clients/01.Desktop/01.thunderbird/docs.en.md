Thunderbird is a powerful open-source email client, calendar and RSS-Feed manager.

|For linux users we recommend using your distribution package manager to get the latest and updatable version of Thunderbird.|

2. **Open Thunderbird**
If it's the first time you run Thunderbird you will be directly greeted with account setup and skip directly to **step 3**.  
If you  are using thunderbird already and have some accounts setup just select "**New Account**" icon in the root view.

 - Click "**Continue**" button once you're done and verified everything is correct..
