# CryptPad Basics

# Documents management

## Create a document
To create a new document you can either do it from the **CryptPad** main page...

![](en/main.png)

or from the **CryptDrive** by clicking the **+ New** button.

If you create a document from the main page, once it is open, a message will prompt in the lower right corner asking you whether you want to store it or not.

You can configure how CryptPad should manage the pads you visit (set if they are automatically or manually stored) in the **Confidentiality** tab at your [**user settings**](../configurations#confidentiality).

If you choose to store them, a message will appear indicating they were added to your drive.

Now you can access the document from your drive.

## Saving changes
CryptPad automatically saves the changes made on documents. Under the title, you will see a notification when changes have been saved.

## Toolbar & pads options

![](en/toolbar.png)

The main options you will find in the **toolbar** are:

1. **File**: here you have several options regarding the document you are working on

![](en/file_menu.png)

- **+ New**: create a new document.

- **Snapshots**: it creates a specific point in the document history that you can name and use as a reference. To create a snapshot from the current state of a document, click on this option and giving it a name. Also from this same menu you can view (open), restore and/or delete snapshots.

- **History**: the history of a document is automatically saved and you can navigate to a certain point and restore it if you needed. To view and restore the history of a document, click on this option and use the arrows to navigate between each edit, each author or each editing session (when the same group of authors was connected to the document) in the history. Once you have found the desired version, click on the **RESTORE** button to restore it. You can also make a snapshot from the history line of a pad.

- **Make a copy**: creates a duplicate of a file.

- **Export**: exports the document to a local file in .html, .md or .doc format.

## Share
As guest user, you have two ways to share documents (Contacts sharing requires to be logged in):
