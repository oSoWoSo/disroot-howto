## Welcome to **Disroot's How-to site**

The main goal of this site is to help you find your way around the various Disroot services.

To cover all the services, with all it's Disroot's provided features, for all platforms and/or Operating Systems it's a very ambitious and time consuming project that requires a lot of work. We think it could be beneficial not only for our users (disrooters) but the entire Open Source and Free Software community running the same or similar software.

In order to do so, any help from disrooters is always needed and welcome. So, if you think there's a missing tutorial, the information is not accurate or could be improve, please contact us or (even better) start writing a how-to yourself.<br>

We use **[git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)**, so you could just submit a "pull request" to our repository. If you're not familiar with this tool, you can submit changes or suggestions via etherpad or email. [**Here**](/contribute) there's a very simple git how-to.<br>

In addition, we're building a glossary to help everyone not familiar with some terms and concepts. You can find it [here](/glossary).

Let's start...
