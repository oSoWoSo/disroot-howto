Disroot has calendar, contacts and tasks apps enabled. 

In this tutorial we'll show you how to setup and use your disroot calendar, contacts and tasks in your Android device.

Contacts have already been addressed in another tutorial by @muzirian, so we won't go in to much details about it.

Note: This was done using an old Android phone 4.+, there may be some differences with other versions.

To do this you will need to install the DAVdroid app and Open Tasks in Android.
For Open Tasks to work it will need DAVdroid to also be installed, but if you just want to sync your calendar or contacts you don't need to install Open Tasks.

**Install DAVdroid**<a name="installDAV"></a>

DAVdroid It's available in F-Droid and in other commercial app stores.

If you have nextcloud mobile app installed and linked to your disroot cloud you can install it from there:

* open your nextcloud mobile app
* go to settings
* press "Sync calendar and contacts"

And it will fetch DAVdroid from whatever app store you have installed, and DAVdroid should open with your username and server address already placed.

**Contacts**<a name="viewdis"></a>

There you can change from "All contacts" to "DAVdroid" and your disroot contacts, you can also go to customize, and select to display contacts from specific sources you want (sim card, disroot, telegram, etc, instead of all.
