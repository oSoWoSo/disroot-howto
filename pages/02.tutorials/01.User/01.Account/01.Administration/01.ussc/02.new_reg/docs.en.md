# New Account Registration
Although the process is pretty simple, we will see it step by step.

!! **When registering an account, please keep the following in mind:**
!! - Use the same device you fill out the form to open the verification link (otherwise, registration could fail).
!! - After 15 minutes the session expires and you will need to restart the process.
!! - If you are using TOR or a VPN and your IP has changed during the process, it will be considered as a security attack and therefore your session could get blocked.


## Step by step registration
###  01: The User Name
This will be the name of your account and email and cannot be modified after created it. Your account name will look like _**username@disroot.org**_

### 02: The Screen Name
The screen name is the name that will be displayed in services that requires login, like **Cloud** or **Email**. Usually it is the same as your username, but you can choose anything you want.<br>
For example, your username could be _username_ and your screen name _User Name_.

### 03: The question
The verification question is intended to check that you are human, not a spam bot, and to keep spammers as far away as possible.

!! **The answer should meet the following requirements**:
!! - It should be at least 150 characters long.
!! - It must be the answer to the question, nothing more.
!! - It cannot be a quote or a copy/paste from an external source.
!! - It can be in any language, though we suggest you to use English.
!! - It cannot contain specific or special characters from another language than English. This means you should avoid using accents or, for example, the letter Ã±.

### 04: The verification email
In order to complete the registration process, it is necessary to send you a verification code to a valid email. Also in this step, you can choose to use this same address for future password reset in case you need it. If you prefer not to do so, **remember to keep your password safe** as **this email address is removed from our database once the request is appoved/denied and we cannot reset it**.

Then enter your password twice, checking that it meets the password rules, and click the **Continue** button to finish.

And that's it! **\0/**
