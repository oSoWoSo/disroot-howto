#  How2 Self-export your personal data

At Disroot pretty much all data is the one you provide when using services (we store your files because you choose to store files on our cloud). We have no interest in acquiring and collecting any extra data nor we process it to sell to advertisement companies or in any way use to monetize on it. Therefor most of the services provide you with a way to self export your data. This chapter will cover tutorials that will help you get all the data stored on services provided by Disroot and connected to your account.
