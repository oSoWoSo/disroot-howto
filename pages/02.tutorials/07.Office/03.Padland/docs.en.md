![](en/create_blank.png)
- **Pad name (URL)**: set the pad name if you know it. For example if the pad address you want to add is *https://pad.disroot.org/p/test* just add *test* here.
- **Pad Alias**: you can an alias if the pad address/name doesn't make to much sense to you. For example, if the pad address is *https://pad.disroot.org/p/1r4o_f6-Rzc* you may want to set *Shopping_list* as an alias!
- **Choose a server**: you can choose any server. If you set **Disroot** in your server list as explained above, then you can choose **Disroot** now.
- Click on **Create or go to** when you're done. If the pad exists, then you will go to it. If it doesn't, it will be created.
