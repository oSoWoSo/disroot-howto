## What does block a channel do?

Well, lets say you don't want any contact with somebody, You can block that contact.
This means in Hubzilla that he will not be able to read any of your item, and that channel will als not be able to write to your channel. It doesn' matter with what permission you post someting. That channel will still be unable to see your activies.
