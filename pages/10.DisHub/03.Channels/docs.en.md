#####Before creating a channel, you first need to know what a channel is.

###So what is a channel?

You can see a channel like being a Facebook wall, a timeline of posts like Tweeter or Mastodon, etc. Basically, info that you want to share with others, and that others may share with you. The great thing and difference with those services: with your account you can create as many channel as you want! So if you want to have one channel about cooking and another one about animals, you can!

For most people, their first channel with be "Me".  
The most important features for a channel that represents "me" are:

* Secure and private "spam free" communications
* Identity and "single-signon" across the entire network
* Privacy controls and permissions which extend to the entire network
* Directory services (like a phone book)


In short, a channel that represents yourself is "me, on the internet".
