## Learn the basics about **Disroot**.

This site is dedicated to Howtos and tutorials to help you find your way around the various Disroot services.

If you feel you are missing a tutorial, or that the information is not accurate- please feel free to
contact us or write a revision yourself.
We are using git so if you are familiar with it, you could just submit a pull request. Otherwise contact us in any other way. Soon we will produce a simple git howto (or at least link to one) to get all interested people onboard.
