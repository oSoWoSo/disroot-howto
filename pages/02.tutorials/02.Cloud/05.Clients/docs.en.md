# What is a client?

In the context of computing and Information Technologies (IT), a "**client**" is a software program or a computer that interacts with and uses resources of another computer that is called "**server**".

In the guides on this site, we will use the term to refer to the first one, the software.

With a client, you can access some of the **Disroot Cloud** main features (such as email, calendars, contacts, files, tasks, etc) directly from your computer or mobile device.

Since there are many, we will try to cover mainly those that are **Free and Open Source software** and, in our opinion, are the most complete.

Of course, if you use one that is not in these **Howtos** and you consider that it should be, you can collaborate with the community by writting one yourself (see the [How to Contribute](/contribute) section).
