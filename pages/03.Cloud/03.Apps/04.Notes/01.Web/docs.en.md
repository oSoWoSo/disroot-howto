# Notes settings

Before you start creating new notes you may want to change settings first.  
In the settings (gear icon bottom left) you can choose in witch folder and in what format the notes will be saved. By default notes will be saved as .txt files in the Notes folder.

# Favourite notes

You can mark your notes as favourite so they will show up in top of the list. That is easily done by clicking on the star icon.
Clicking the star icon again will remove the favourite mark.

# Categories

It is also possible to order your notes in categories. For that you need to go in the files app of Nextcloud and create a new folder with the name of the category you want to add in the Notes folder. After that you move the note file in the desired folder.

Now when you move back in the notes app you will find your notes ordered in categories.
