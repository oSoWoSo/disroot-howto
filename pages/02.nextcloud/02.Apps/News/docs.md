You add RSS-feed of your favorite sites, get notification on new articles, and read then without the need to go to all those websites, by opening lots of tabs and get distracted half way.

So let's get things rolling:

To add the feed simply click on the **"+ Subscribe"** button and fill in the URL of the feed you previously copied.
