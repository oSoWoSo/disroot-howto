Disroot has calendar app enabled.

In this tutorial we'll show you how to setup and use your disroot calendar on your Android device.
To do this you will need to install the DAVx⁵ app and Tasks in Android.
For Tasks to work it will need DAVx⁵ to also be installed, but if you just want to sync your calendar or contacts you don't need to install Tasks.


----------
# Install DAVx⁵
## From appstore
DAVx⁵ Is available on your favourite app store. We encourage you to use [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/).


## From NextcloudApp
If you have nextcloud mobile app installed and linked to your Disroot cloud you can install it from there:
 - Open Nextcloud Android App
 - Got to settings > **"Sync calendar and contacts"**

 NextcloudApp will now fetch, install and configure your account automagically.

 ---------------

## Add your Disroot account to DAVx⁵

If you haven't install DAVx⁵ via NextcloudApp you will have to manually setup an account.
To get started open-up "DAVx⁵ app" and press the *"plus"* (**+**) button.

# Calendar
If you have DAVx⁵ installed on your device then your Calendars from Disroot will be synced to your device and will appear in your Calendar app of choice. Any event added on the phone will be automatically synced to Disroot and vice versa.
Make sure your Disroot calendar is the only one selected (at least if you exclusively want to use Disroot calendar) or you will probably syncing with Google calendar.

And if you want to use multiple calendars don't forget to select wich calendar you want to use each time you want to add an item.

After that, the calendars in your Disroot account that you selected will be synced and visible in your Android device calendar.
