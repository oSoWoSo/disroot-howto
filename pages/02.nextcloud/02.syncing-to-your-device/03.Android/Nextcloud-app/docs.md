The ability to easily synchronize, upload and download files from your Disroot cloud to your mobile can be very useful in several cases. 

In this tutorial we'll show you how to install and work with the Nextcloud mobile app. This app permits you to conveniently access and synchronize your Disroot cloud files from your mobile and download/upload/share/delete without having to use a browser in your mobile to do it or connect it to a laptop to transfer files.

This app does not download the files to a local folder in your mobile, it simply shows the existing files in your cloud. The files are only downloaded if you select them to be downloaded. This way it wont take too much space in your mobile. For uploaded files, if you want to you can keep a local copy in your mobile or not, it's your choice.

##Get and install Nextcloud Mobile app<a name="installmobileapp"></a>

To install the app on android, we recommend you install the [F-droid](https://f-droid.org/) app store. F-droid provides open source applications, and it's way to reduce your dependency of google.

After you installed and setup F-droid you can search and install the [Nexcloud Mobile app](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=Nextcloud&fdid=com.nextcloud.client/).

IOS users will probably have to pay around 0,99â‚¬ for it in the IOS app store. 


----------

##Setup account<a name="setupaccount"></a>

* **Server:** [https://cloud.disroot.org](https://cloud.disroot.org)
* **Username:** _your Disroot username_
* **Password:** _your Disroot password_

And press connect at the end.
