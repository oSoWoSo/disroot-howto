##News App on Disroot<a name="web"></a>
<br>
To get into the app form webbrowser ,just click news app icon <img src="/uploads/default/original/1X/f59d6ff066f9c23f6e8088aa6eb5171dfd997076.png" width="21" height="19"> in the top bar. General idea behind the app is very simple. You add feed of your favorite sites, get notification on new articles, and read then without the need to go to the website, open lots of tabs and get distracted half way. 

So let's get things rolling:
###Add new feeds
Most of the websites provide [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) or Atom feeds. Feeds are usually represented by this <img src="/uploads/default/original/1X/8230b4cc755b6e3f1b82bb0501203454000f1cd9.png" width="15" height="15"> icon or by guessing the feed url like: https://disroot.org/feed (yes we need to change that). Once you have the link ready you can copy it and add it to your news app.
To add the feed simply click on the **"+ Subscribe"** button and fill in the URL of the feed you previously copied.

For better overview and sorting you can create Folders and assign feeds to them. To create new folder hit **"+ New Folder"** button on the left-side bar. Now you can "drag and drop" feeds you wish to add to folders.

###Feed options
Every feed can be optimized to your needs. Clicking on <img src="/uploads/default/original/1X/0e30474434d0516cc3ecdecef8626f4d486170a8.png" width="36" height="25"> icon:

### Get it
To get news app on your android device we recommend visiting f-droid and adding it's app store. [F-droid](https://f-droid.org/) provides free (as in freedom) and trusted applications. Using that store over Google Play is a great step forward to free yourself. 

Once you have f-droid installed and running, you can search for [OCReader](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=news&fdid=email.schaal.ocreader) within the F-droid app or download and install it directly form the [website](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=news&fdid=email.schaal.ocreader)

### Setup
When that's done you can fire up the app, and login with your disroot account.

Once you're logged in, all your news feeds will be synced to your device, and you can start reading immediately. 
Swiping to the left show you your account information and give you the list of subscribed feeds as well as number of unread posts.
