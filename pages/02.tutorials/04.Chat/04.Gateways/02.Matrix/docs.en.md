# Matrix bridge
You can connect to any **Matrix** room hosted on any **Matrix** server via **Matrix.org bridge**. To join a Matrix room:

`#room#matrix.domain.ldt@matrix.org`

Where `#room` is the **Matrix** room you want to join and `matrix.domain.tld` is the **Matrix server address** you want to join. Make sure to leave `@matrix.org` as it is, because it's the **Matrix bridge address**.
