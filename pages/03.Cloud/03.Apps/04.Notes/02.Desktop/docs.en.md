# Notes

To use **Nextcloud** Notes on your **Gnome** desktop, you'll need to add your **Nextcloud** account first, following the **Set Online accounts** steps of the [Gnome desktop integration](../../../clients/desktop/gnu-linux/gnome-desktop-integration) how-to.

Now you need to install **Gnome-Notes (Bijiben)** on your distro. Once you've did it, launch **Gnome-Notes** and your notes will automatically be synced.

# Set Nextcloud as primary book

You will need to set your **Nextcloud** account as default if you want your new notes to be automatically synced with your cloud.

To do so you follow the next steps:
- Click on the three dots menu
