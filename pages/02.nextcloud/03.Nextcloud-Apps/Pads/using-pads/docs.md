tyitle: 'Using collaborative pads and spreadsheets'

Since April 11th 2016 Disroot has enabled [pad (etherpad)](https://pad.disroot.org) and [spreadsheet (ethercalc)](https://calc.disroot.org) management directly in your owncloud interface. Now you will be able to create new "files", share them with others and process them just like any other file in your cloud, while still enjoying the seamless collaborative editing function.

**Note!** Those aren't files containing your data but links to your work on either https://pad.disroot.org or https://calc.disroot.org. All the pads and spreadsheets are **removed after 3 months of inactivity** so please keep that in mind, and when you are done working on the pads, make a "real" copy and place it in your owncloud files.

To create pads or calcs within owncloud, simple click on the "+" icon, just as if you were creating a text file, a new folder or uploading stuff.

Now give it a name and once the pad is created, you will see it listed as any other file in your owncloud files:

Once you click on the name you will be redirected to either [pad](https://pad.disroot.org) or [calc](https://calc.disroot.org) where you can continue your work. 

When in the "pad", you can see the name of the pad in the top bar. This is not the real name. For better security, the real name consists of random characters, making it almost impossible to guess by unauthorized people. If you want to know the real url of the pad you are working on, simply hover over the name in the top bar:

Please note once again that the created (ether)file in your owncloud files is just a link to actual pad or spreadsheet and that all pads and spreadsheets that are inactive for 3 months will be deleted.
